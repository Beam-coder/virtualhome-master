# Mingqian_sensors
This program can read the sensors' states at https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome. We need to replace unity_demo.ipynb and add main.py in their corresponding folder. Then run "Mingqian's sensors"  
I would like to appreciate my tutors BOUCHABOU Damien, LOHR Christophe, NGUYEN Mai for their help and suggestions to my work.
